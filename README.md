# 🐍 Snake Game using Python Turtle

I built this Snake Game as a fun way to practice Python, especially using the Turtle graphics module.  
The game uses smooth movement logic, screen updates, and basic animation principles to mimic the classic snake game.

## 🎮 Features

- Snake made up of segments (using Turtle objects)
- Smooth and clean movement logic
- Head and body coordination using `.xcor()`, `.ycor()`, and `.goto()`
- Easy to expand (e.g., adding food, scoring, collision detection)

## 🧠 What I Learned

- Working with lists and loops to manage snake body
- Controlling animation with `screen.tracer()` and `screen.update()`
- Using object positions (`xcor()`, `ycor()`) for following logic
- Structuring real-time game logic with a `while` loop

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Make sure Python is installed (version 3.7+ recommended).
2. Save the game file as `main.py`.
3. Run the script:

```bash
python main.py
